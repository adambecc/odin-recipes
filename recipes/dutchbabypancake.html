    <p>
        A Dutch Baby pancake is like a cross between a popover and a crepe.<br>
        It’s essentially a giant skillet pancake made with a thin, eggy batter<br>
        that puffs up around the edges as it bakes in the oven. A Dutch baby is<br>
        light, more eggy, and less cake-like than traditional American pancakes.<br>
        It looks super fancy, but trust me it’s actually very easy to make.<br><br>

    <h1>Recipe:</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <h>

                    All-Purpose Flour: Flour adds structure and is the foundation of the pancake. <br><br>

                    Milk: Milk combines with the flour to add moisture and helps create the batter.<br><br>

                    Egg: Eggs add more moisture and helps hold the pancake together.<br><br>

                    Sugar: Just a little bit of sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness to the pancake.<br><br>

                    Vanilla Extract: A small amount of vanilla extract adds a wonderful flavor and<br>
                    depth to the pancake.<br><br>

                    Salt: A little bit of salt helps enhance the flavor of the pancake.<br><br>

                    Butter: Butter adds flavor and richness to the pancake and it also gives it that beautiful <br>
                    golden brown color around the edges.<br><br>

                </h>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <h>
                    Prepare the batter first. In a large blender, add the eggs, milk, all-purpose flour, sugar,<br>
                    salt, and vanilla extract. Blend until completely smooth and no lumps remain. Let the batter<br> 
                    sit at room temperature to warm.<br><br>

                    Place a 10-inch cast iron skillet in the oven and begin preheating to 425ºF. Let the skillet <br>
                    heat in the oven for an additional 10 minutes once the oven reaches the set temperature.<br><br>
                    
                    Using an oven mitt, carefully remove the skillet from the oven and add the butter. Swirl the <br>
                    butter around in the skillet and place it back in the oven for 30-60 more seconds until the <br>
                    butter begins to brown (be careful not to let it burn).<br><br>
                    
                    Carefully remove the skillet from the oven again and swirl the butter evenly across the bottom <br>
                    and up the sides of the skillet. Quickly pour the prepared batter into the hot skillet.<br><br>
                    
                    Return the hot skillet to the hot oven and bake for 14-15 minutes, or until it is golden brown <br>
                    and has puffed along the edges and in the center.<br><br>
                    
                    Once the Dutch baby has finished baking, slice the pancake into four or six pieces and serve <br>
                    with maple syrup and fresh berries on top (optional).<br><br>

                    IMPORTANT: Use an iron skillet!!!

        <h2>How to serve it:</h2>
            <ul>
                <h>
                    You can easily serve this dutch baby straight from the cast iron skillet or transfer it to<br>
                    a serving plate. We dusted ours with a little bit of powdered sugar and served it with fresh<br>
                    berries and pure maple syrup poured over the top. But feel free to play around with other<br>
                    toppings like whipped cream, hot buttered apples, pecans, yogurt, Nutella, lemon curd, or<br>
                    for a really fun twist try our Almond Dutch Baby with Ricotta and Jam!<br>
