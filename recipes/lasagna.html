        Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,<br>

    </p>
    <p>

        made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers<br>

    </p>
    <p>

        of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables,<br>

    </p>
    <p>

        cheeses, and seasonings and spices.<br>
    </p>

    <h1>Recipe:</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h>
        Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and<br>
        parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.<br><br>

        Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef,<br>
        add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor,<br>
        or make my homemade Italian sausage.<br><br>

        Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce<br>
        (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).<br>
        If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.<br><br>
    </h>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h>
        Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the recipe below.<br><br>
        Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well,<br>
        add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.<br><br>

        Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.<br><br>
        Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake<br>
        until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.<br>
    </h>
    <h2>Layering</h2>
    <h>
        Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.<br>
        Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers,<br>
        ending with a layer of noodles and sauce. Cover with foil and bake.<br>
        Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.<br>
    </h>

    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
