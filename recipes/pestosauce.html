    </h3>
    <h1>Recipe:</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h>
        2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed<br>
        1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated<br>
        1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil<br>
        1/3 cup pine nuts<br>
        3 garlic cloves, minced<br>
        Salt, to taste<br>
        Freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>
        Optional: A squeeze of lemon juice (to brighten the flavor)<br><br>
    </h>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h>
        Toast the pine nuts:<br>
        In a dry pan over medium heat, toast the pine nuts until golden and fragrant (about 2-3 minutes).<br>
        Be sure to stir frequently to avoid burning. Set aside to cool.<br><br>

        Blend the basil and garlic:<br>
        In a food processor or blender, combine the fresh basil leaves and minced garlic.<br>
        Pulse until the basil is coarsely chopped.<br><br>

        Add pine nuts and cheese:<br>
        Add the toasted pine nuts and grated Parmesan cheese to the food processor.<br>
        Pulse a few times until the mixture is combined.<br><br>

        Slowly add olive oil:<br>
        While the food processor is running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil.<br>
        Continue blending until the pesto is smooth and emulsified. You may need to scrape<br>
        down the sides of the bowl occasionally to ensure even mixing.<br><br>

        Season to taste:<br>
        Season the pesto with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and an optional<br>
        squeeze of lemon juice. Blend briefly to incorporate.<br><br>

        Store or serve:<br>
        You can use the pesto immediately, or store it in an airtight container<br>
        in the refrigerator for up to a week. To help preserve the color, pour<br>
        a thin layer of olive oil on top of the pesto before storing.<br><br>
    </h>

    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
