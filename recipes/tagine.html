        “Tagine” refers to a cone-shaped cooking vessel from North Africa <br>
        well as the stew that is cooked inside. All sorts of foods are <br>
        cooked in tagines, from vegetables to meat and fish. Warm spices <br>
        come together with the natural juices that seep from the cooking <br>
        meat and vegetables to form the sauce that makes tagines so irresistible. <br>
    </p>

    <h1>Recipe:</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h>
        The best lamb to use for lamb tagine is lamb shoulder. It’s a tough cut<br>
        of meat that is made for slow cooking that’s marbled with fat so it’s beautifully juicy.<br>
        Sometimes it is generically sold as “lamb stew meat”.<br>
        <br>
        Garlic, onion and ginger – Aromatic flavour base. Don’t skip the ginger!<br>
        <br>
        Cinnamon sticks – A spice traditionally used in Middle Eastern cooking and makes<br>
        the flavour so special. You can substituted with a little powder but cinnamon sticks works better.<br>
        It’s a little more subtle and earthier.<br>
        <br>
        Chicken stock/broth – The braising liquid. Traditionally water is used, but stock makes it tastier! <br>Note: Chicken stock is used rather than lamb stock because the flavour is “cleaner”. Lamb stock is<br> not sold at grocery stores, and there’s a reason for that – because it’s very…well, lamb!<br>We get enough lamb flavour in this sauce from the lamb pieces.<br>
        <br>
        Dried apricots – Some versions of tagine are made with olives, others use dried fruit,<br>
        others still may use both. I’ve opted for fruit because tagines are one of the few dishes I love that<br> pairs fruit with meat! I also think the orange colour of the apricots looks lovely in the sauce.<br>
        <br>
        However, the recipe includes the olive option too.<br>
        <br>
        Tomato paste – This is what is used to thicken the sauce and add a touch of flavour.<br>
        We don’t use enough to make it tomatoey, it’s very subtle.<br>
        <br>
        Lemon – Some tagines use preserved lemon (like in my chicken tagine) but for lamb,<br>
        fresh lemon zest is beautiful. Also – cheaper. <br>
        <br>
        Slivered almonds and coriander/cilantro – Garnish for serving. A good amount of both works! <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h>
        1.  How to make Lamb tagine<br>
        <br>
        Brown lamb – Cut the lamb into large 3.5cm / 1.5″ cubes so they don’t become<br>
        fall-apart tender too quickly. Cooking long and slow = more flavour in the<br>
        sauce and it needs the time to reduce and thicken!
        <br>
        <br>
        Toss the lamb in salt and pepper, brown in three batches (don’t crowd the pot<br>
        else the lamb will stew instead of brown) then remove into a bowl.
        <br>
        <br>
        Use a large oven-proof pot with a lid, so it can go from the stove to oven.<br>
        My dutch oven pictured is 24cm / 9.5″ wide.
        <br>
        <br>
        2.  Sauté aromatics – Cook the garlic and onion first, then the tomato paste,<br>
        ginger, cinnamon and spices. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes, stirring constantly,<br>
        to cook out the raw flavour of the tomato paste and toast the spices which<br>
        brings out the flavour.
        <br>
        <br>
        3.  Braising liquid and lamb – Add the chicken stock, water and lamb,<br>
        then bring it to a simmer.
        <br>
        <br>
        4.  First cook 45 minutes – Put the lid on and transfer to a 180°F/350°F<br>
        (160°C fan-forced) oven for 45 minutes. 
        <br>
        <br>
        5.  Add apricots then stir them in. We add them in partway through else they get too soft.
        <br>
        <br>
        6.  Cook another 1 hour – Put the lid on then return the tagine to the oven<br>
        for a further 1 hour, or until the lamb pieces are fork tender.
        <br>
        <br>
        7.  Thick and full of flavour – Here’s what the lamb tagine looks like after<br>
        1 hour 45 minutes of slow cooking. The sauce has reduced down to a thick<br>
        consistency, rich with spicing and a beautiful depth of flavour you can only<br>
        achieve from slow cooking.
        <br>
        <br>
        8.  Serve over couscous. I just use plain couscous for this tagine because<br>
        it’s got so much flavour in it, rather than one with fruit and nuts in it.
        <br>
        <br>

    <h2>Why Oven?</h2>
    <h>
        As with any slow cooking recipe I share, I know some people will ask<br>
        if it can be cooked using the slow cooker or on the stove! Unfortunately<br>
        for this lamb tagine, the oven works best.
        <br>
        <br>
        The stove wouldn’t work very well because you’d need to stir frequently<br>
        to prevent the base from catching as the sauce of this tagine is considerably<br>
        thicker than say, Beef Stew. But because the lamb pieces gets so tender,<br>
        it will break apart into the sauce.
        <br>
        <br>
        The slow cooker also doesn’t work that well because the sauce will not<br>
        reduce nearly enough in the slow cooker. So the sauce is too thin and will lack flavour.<br>
        Cooking in the slow cooker also means you don’t get caramelisation on the surface and edges of the<br> tagine like you do in the oven and on the stove which adds flavour to stews.
        <br>
        <br>
        For some dishes you can get around this by finishing a dish cooked in the slow cooker<br>
        in the oven, like I do with Slow Cooker BBQ Brisket and Slow Cooker Roast Lamb Leg.<br>
        But unfortunately not for stews like this tagine!
