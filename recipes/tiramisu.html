    <p>There are many, many Tiramisu recipes out there in this big wide world.<br>
        Some are complicated. Some are very shortcut, made using cream in a can.<br><br>

        This is a proper Italian Tiramisu recipe. The way it’s made in Italy and<br>
        the GOOD Italian restaurants.<br><br>
        
        There is no whipping cream.<br><br>
        
        And it’s made using raw eggs. <br><br>
        
        I know that concerns some people. And in fact, somewhere along the lines of history,<br>
        someone (non Italian!) got scared about eating raw eggs so they decided to start making<br>
        Tiramisu using tempered eggs (eggs whisked over a water bath).<br><br>
        
        While food safety may have been a valid concern in the past, these days in Western<br>
        countries (certainly in Australia), the quality of eggs sold in reputable stores is<br>
        good enough such that you won’t need to worry about consuming raw eggs.<br><br>

    <h1>Recipe:</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <h>
                    Lady fingers aka Pavesini or Savoiardi biscuits – pretty widely available nowadays,<br> 
                    at least here in Australia. Sold at grocery stores in the biscuit aisle, delis and<br> 
                    fruit ‘n veg shops. They are crisp, sweet sponge fingers that taste like vanilla;<br> <br> 
                </h>
                <h>
                    Mascarpone – it’s a very thick, rich Italian cream that has a consistency like cream<br> 
                    cheese (see video for consistency). Australians – do NOT use Woolworths or any generic<br> 
                    home brand as they are too thin and won’t set, so your cream layer will be too thin.<br> <br> 
                </h>
                <h>
                    Coffee – Tiramisu ain’t Tiramisu without coffee for dunking the biscuits!<br> 
                    You’ll see me using an espresso machine in the video, but in my pre coffee machine days,<br> 
                    I always used coffee granules.<br> <br> 
                </h>
                <h>
                    Frangelico or other liquor – I am actually not really much of a fan of liquor<br> 
                    in my sweets, but Tiramisu is the exception! I like Frangelico because it’s a hazelnut<br> 
                    flavoured liquor, and also very partial to Kahlua which is coffee flavoured.<br> 
                    Other options: Rum, brandy, Bailey’s – go wild, use what you love,<br> 
                    or even keep it virgin (almond essence, vanilla extract!)<br> <br> 
                </h>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <h>
                    The key to a rich-yet-light Tiramisu is to beat the egg whites until fluffy,<br> 
                    then fold it through the rich cream mixture of sugar, yolks and mascarpone.<br> <br> 

                    This technique creates a Tiramisu cream which has a consistency like whipped cream <br> 
                    (ie soft and spreadable) but it sets in a way that cream never can so you can cut<br> 
                    through the Tiramisu to reveal the layers.<br> <br> 

                    I say it “sets”, but it’s still very soft and creamy – it’s a unique texture<br> 
                    that sets proper Tiramisu recipes apart from quick version made with whipping cream!<br> <br>

            </ul>
        <h2>Layering</h2>
            <ul>
                <h>
                    My favourite part! And it goes down like this: <br><br>

                    <ul>    
                        <h>
                            Dunk biscuits in coffee-Frangelico<br><br>

                            Cover base of dish<br><br>

                            Top with half the Tiramisu cream<br><br>

                            Repeat!<br><br>
                        </h>
                    </ul>        

                    TIP: Dunk quickly! 2 seconds total for each biscuit. Any longer and the biscuit will literally disintegrate in your hands!<br><br>
                </h>
            </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
